<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started operating the farm in 2004, taking over from Gilbert's grandparents. Since then we have expanded from poultry and now milk Holsteins and Jerseys as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Hatch Eggs</u>- We sell brown and white hatch eggs for small and larger customers. These eggs are great for someone who wants to hatch out their own layers.&nbsp;Prices can change with each flock so contact us for more information.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Table Eggs</u>- In 2012 we decided to step back from grading our own eggs, we currently sell our eggs to Maritime Pride Eggs (located in Amherst, NS) and they grade and sell the eggs within the Atlantic provinces.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Ready-to-Lay Pullets</u>- We sell pullets to quota customers along with smaller customers who just want a few hens in their backyard. We deliver to Nova Scotia and all over&nbsp;New Brunswick&nbsp;both spring and fall, depending on the order we will also deliver to PEI. We also have a pick up day where customers who have placed orders outside of our delivery areas can come and pick up their order. These birds are a bovan brown and a hisex white, sometimes we have black available as well. These birds are ready to be sold both spring and fall when they are between 17 and 19 weeks.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Day old Chicks</u>- Along side Gilbert's grandmother we sell day old broilers (meat kings) and layers. Whether you want 10 to grow for your own chicken or several hundred! We do this in the spring and summer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For information on any of the above items or to place an order just click the <strong>Contact Us</strong> link and follow instructions!</p>
