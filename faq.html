<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How big is your operation?</h3>
<p>We are a small family operation, with one full time employee plus a couple part time employees depending on the season to help with milking and field work.</p>
<h3>What bio-security features take place on a poultry farm?</h3>
<p>With poultry bio-security is very important to running a farm, it is for this reason that people are not given tours of our poultry barns and that we request that you make an appointment before visiting. All barns are kept locked and employees are required to wear certain clothing depending on the barns. We visit barns from the youngest to the oldest. In each barn we change footwear and wear coveralls when entering the flock.</p>
